# Deep Learning Nanodegree Projects

These are my completed projects from [Udacity's](https://www.udacity.com) [Deep Learning Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree--nd101)

[Here](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning) is Udacity's repo for this nanodegree and these projects.

#### Downloading project files

Downloaded the project files from each project workspace on Udacity by zipping it first `tar -czvf project-folder.tar.gz project-folder` and then downloading the compressed file from the UI.
